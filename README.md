# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Module 17 Challenge


#### Project Overview
Project to help the Amazon Vine program analyze written reviews by their paid members. The Amazon Vine Program is a service for manufacturers and publishers to recieve
reviews for their products. There are companies such as SellBy that pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members who are required to publish a
review. Using the picked dataset and the skills learned with Pyspark to perform and ETL process to extract and transform the data, connecting to an AWS RDS instance, and loading the trasnformed data into pgAdmin. Then it will be determined if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from the Vine members in the dataset.


### Deliverables
1. Perform an ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
2. Determine Bias of Vine Reviews
3. Written Report of Analysis (README)


### Summary
From the analysis of this dataset there is bias for the reviews in the Vine program because they are less likely to be helpful reviews. To further analyze this dataset
to support this statement is to filter it further by included verified purchases to make our data more reliable.
